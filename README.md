In this compelling data science project, I delved into the intricate realm of salary prediction using a rich dataset sourced from Glassdoor. Leveraging advanced statistical techniques, the primary focus was on applying Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and various regression techniques to unravel patterns and insights within the data.

The cornerstone of the analysis was the utilization of Linear Regression, along with other sophisticated regression models, to discern the underlying factors influencing salary variations. By harnessing the power of data, I aimed to create a robust predictive model that could unveil meaningful correlations between different variables and salary outcomes.

Through meticulous exploration and analysis, I not only fine-tuned the models but also gained valuable insights into the nuances of salary determinants within the context of the dataset. This project not only showcases my adeptness in statistical modeling but also underscores my ability to extract actionable insights from complex datasets.

By applying cutting-edge regression techniques to the Glassdoor dataset, this project stands as a testament to my proficiency in data science and my capability to derive tangible value from diverse and expansive datasets.
